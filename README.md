## Installation

To get started with CHexDumpLibrary, you can download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/mohvmesefy/CHexDumpLibrary/releases). Simply download the appropriate file for your system, and follow the instructions provided in the release notes.

### Prerequisites

Before you install, ensure you have the following:

- A C/C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.)
- Basic understanding of C/C++ programming

## Usage

Using CHexDumpLibrary is straightforward. Here’s a basic outline of how to use it:

1. **Include the Header**: Include the library header in your source file.
2. **Call the Function**: Use the provided functions to print hex dumps.

### Example Code

Here’s a simple example of how to use CHexDumpLibrary:

```c
#include "chexdump.h"

int main() {
    const char *data = "Hello, World!";
    hexdump(data, strlen(data));
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `hexdump` function prints the hex representation of the string "Hello, World!".

## Examples

### Hex Dump from Memory

To print a hex dump from a memory buffer, you can use the following code:

```c
#include "chexdump.h"

void print_memory_dump() {
    char buffer[16] = {0x48, 0x65, 0x6C, 0x6C, 0x6F, 0x2C, 0x20, 0x57,
                       0x6F, 0x72, 0x6C, 0x64, 0x21, 0x00};

    hexdump(buffer, sizeof(buffer));
}
```

### Hex Dump from File

To print a hex dump from a file, you can use the following code:

```c
#include "chexdump.h"

void print_file_dump(const char *filename) {
    FILE *file = fopen(filename, "rb");
    if (file) {
        hexdump_file(file);
        fclose(file);
    } else {
        perror("Failed to open file");
    }
}
```
